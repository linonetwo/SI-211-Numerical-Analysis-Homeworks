## 1.

We want to evaluate the function
<InlineMath>
  {String.raw`f(x) = \frac{sin(10^4x)}{x}`}
</InlineMath>
for different values of x.

### (a) Evaluate the above function at x = π by using Matlab, Julia, C++ or any other programming language of your choice. How big is the numerical approximation error? Can you explain why you observe this error?

<div>Apply Math.PI ({Math.PI}) to </div>
<DisplayNumericalErrors value={Math.PI} />

The output was supposed to be zero, so it's the error.

The causes of error are:

- Math.PI ({Math.PI}) is not the real Pi, is's an approximation
- Even we input the real Pi, it got precision lost in binary storage
- That error enlarged by 10e4
- Error hold by f'(x) at Pi which is 1

### (b) Evaluate the above function at x = 1e−10. How big is the numerical evaluation error?

<div>Apply 1 / (10 ** 10) ({1 / (10 ** 10)}) to </div>
<DisplayNumericalErrors value={1 / (10 ** 10)} />

The output was supposed to be zero, so it's the error.

It's amplificated by the denominator so it's so huge.

## 2. Numeric differentiation based on central differences:

### (a)
Implement a function (for example in Python, Julia, or Matlab) that uses numeric differentiation based on central differences,
<InlineMath>
  {String.raw`f'(x) \simeq \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}`}
</InlineMath>
Here, the inputs of the differentiation routine are the scalar function f that we want to differentiate, the point x at which the derivative should be evaluated, and the finite perturbation h > 0. Use the syntax diff(f,x,h) = ...

<Difference />

### (b)

Evaluate the derivative of the function f(x) = exp(x) at x = 0 using the above routine diff. Plot the numerical differentiation error in dependence on h ∈ [10−15, 10−1] and interpret the result. Use logarithmic scales on both axis!

<Difference functionToDiff={x => Math.exp(x)} x={0} hRange={[-15, -1]} actualDifference={1} />

## 3.

In order to evaluate the factorable function
<InlineMath>
  {String.raw`f(x) = sin(cos(x)) \ast cos(x)^2`}
</InlineMath>
we write an evaluation algorithm of the form:

- a0 = x
- a1 = cos(x)
- a2 = a1 ∗ a1
- a3 = sin(a1)
- a4 = a2 ∗ a3
- f(x) = a4 .

### a. What is the corresponding algorithm for evaluating the derivative of f(x) using the forward mode of algorithmic differentiation (AD)? 

- b0 = 1
- b1 = -sin(x) * b0
- b2 = a1 ∗ b1 + b1 * a1
- b3 = cos(a1) * b1
- b4 = a2 ∗ b3 + a3 * b2
- f'(x) = b4 .

### b. What is the order of magnitude of the numerical error that is associated with evaluating the derivative of f at x = 0 using this AD code?

There is only numerical error, which is

<InlineMath>
  {String.raw`\frac{eps}{h} = O(\frac{eps}{h})`}
</InlineMath>
